      My journey in software development began with a curiosity about how things worked "behind the scenes", on the web. This led me to working with various companies across industries from IoT software to revenue cycle management, and even dabbling in enterprise-level projects. Through these experiences, I've developed a strong foundation in debugging, troubleshooting, and finding creative solutions to complex problems.

      I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, problem-solving enthusiasm, and debugging skills to my work, with a passion for building innovative solutions that make a difference.

      What sets me apart is my ability to approach challenges with a humble mindset, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and learning from those experiences. This has helped me grow as an engineer and become more effective in my work.

      When I'm not coding, you can find me spending time with family or exploring new ideas and technologies.`)
