title: "My Ideal Operating System"
summary: "Here I go over the OS of my choice. What I love, and what I hate about the various OS's I've tried over the years."

Over the years, I've found myself navigating the vast universe of operating systems, always searching for that
perfect digital ecosystem. I've dabbled in just about everything, but it's Linux – specifically Ubuntu – that
has consistently felt like the closest thing to my ideal OS, especially for laptops.

My journey hasn't been linear. I've bounced around distributions more times than I can count. But for laptops,
the experience has always clicked best with Ubuntu. There's something reassuring about the "just works" philosophy.
Getting the hardware right – Wi-Fi, graphics, sound, printing – without a constant battle is invaluable. It’s a
testament to the maturity and widespread support Ubuntu offers for modern hardware.

That said, I have a soft spot for another distribution, Deepin. Its desktop environment is undeniably gorgeous,
 sleek and polished. It has a certain aesthetic appeal that really stands out. If Deepin could just nail Wayland
support, it might be the desktop experience I'd choose for a powerful workstation. But for now, Ubuntu's
practicality trumps its visual beauty for my primary laptop use.

My time with Windows? It leaves a sour taste. Honestly, I get a sense of unease using it. It's not that I *know*
the exact reasons – the forced AI features, the upselling during setup, the invasive ads creeping into the
experience, the blue screens, the clunky file system – it all adds up to a vibe I simply don't enjoy. The fact
that the only thing keeping many people tethered is a kernel-level anticheat speaks volumes about its shortcomings
compared to open, well-behaved systems like Linux.

Before Linux, I was a Windows user myself. Then came macOS, initially through my development work. Mac's Unix-l
ike foundation was a revelation; I fell in love with the file system structure and the underlying stability. And
Apple Silicon is undeniably powerful and efficient. But macOS felt... restrictive. And the latest iteration,
with its heavy reliance on the Glass effect (*transparency*), honestly pushed me over the edge. It just wasn't *right* anymore.

So, where does that leave me? After distro-hopping for days, sometimes weeks at a stretch, I've found my equili
brium. Ubuntu provides the stability, support, and hardware compatibility I need, especially when packing my
laptop into a bag for work or travel. It might not be the most visually stunning desktop out there (sometimes),
but it delivers a smooth, reliable, and user-friendly experience that feels genuinely complete. It's the OS I
feel most comfortable and productive with.

That's my take, anyway. Linux, powered by Ubuntu's practical perfection, feels like the ideal operating system
for me right now.
