Securing a job at a company like Netflix is the dream for many in the tech and creative industries. The thought of being scouted by a recruiter you admire, walking through the doors, and potentially landing a coveted role is exhilarating.

For me, that dream scenario turned into a deeply frustrating experience that left me scrambling for answers. This isn't just a story about getting rejected from Netflix; it's a case study in how a few critical missteps can derail even the most promising candidates.

### The Path to the Interview (And the Detour)

The journey began unexpectedly. I met a recruiter – let's call them Alex for confidentiality: Alex was one of the most genuinely kind, insightful, and supportive people I've encountered professionally. We built rapport, and Alex saw potential in me.

Alex informed me about a job opening at Netflix, detailing the role and the team. We then conducted a first-round interview, focusing on preparing me using the [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) method. This was crucial preparation – the kind that makes sense on paper.

Armed with notes and a screen displaying my prepared talking points, I moved on to the actual interview with the Hiring Manager. This manager was incredibly impressive, leaving a lasting impression, even after the outcome was known. The interview itself? It was a behavioral one, asking questions like _"Tell me about a time you excelled"_ and _"Tell me about a time you had a conflict and how you resolved it."_ Standard stuff.

### The Cracks Appear: Nerves and Lack of Preparedness

This is where the carefully laid foundation started to crumble.

Despite the preparation, I was *extremely* nervous. The weight of the opportunity, the caliber of the company, and the presence of the kind recruiter all contributed to a palpable sense of pressure.

In the heat of the moment, I couldn't effectively reference the very points I had prepared. They seemed miles away. While I understood STAR intellectually, I couldn't apply it smoothly under pressure. My answers became disorganized and unfocused.

I simply couldn't answer the basic behavioral questions well. I recall struggling to articulate my experiences coherently, perhaps even choking up – _a truly embarrassing and unproductive situation._

Compounding the issue, I turned down a well-regarded offer from another company (which I was hooked up with by a buddy of mine), hoping to do better in the Netflix interview. Looking back, this was probably a mistake, given the intense competition at Netflix and the relative lack of pressure at the other company.

### The Aftermath and The Real Lesson

The rejection came a few days later. While definitely disappointing, the Hiring Manager was extremely professional and nice. Her name remains etched in my memory, a testament to her kindness, but also a stark reminder of the outcome.

It was a harsh, public (in my own mind) failure. This experience forced me to confront a harsh reality: **I am fundamentally bad at behavioral interviews.** I panic, my preparedness goes out the window, and my answers lack structure and impact.

### Key Takeaways from This Experience

Based on this particular, painful chapter:

Behavioral interviews test your ability to reflect, structure your experiences, and demonstrate specific skills relevant to the role.

Preparation isn't enough, and knowing the STAR method and having points is a start, but execution under pressure requires significantly more practice.

Nerves can be paralyzing, and extreme nervousness can derail even the most prepared candidate. It's not just about the candidate; it's about managing the pressure.

Rejection is data; even from a top-tier company like Netflix, rejection provides invaluable feedback about areas needing improvement. It's not necessarily a reflection of your overall worth, but a specific assessment of fit (or lack thereof) for *that* role *at that time*.

Strategic Decisions Matter; while chasing the dream is good, weighing offers rationally is equally important.

### What It All Means

My rejection from Netflix wasn't just about not being good enough; it was a combination of genuine difficulty with behavioral interviews, overwhelming nerves, and a lack of execution under pressure. The recruiter and Hiring Manager were both incredibly nice people, but the process exposed a critical weakness in my interview skills.

I need dedicated practice, specifically for behavioral interviews. Maybe interviewing more and more often is the key?
I need strategies to manage interview-related anxiety, like deep breathing, visualization, or even some whacky cognitive behavioral techniques might help.
My self-perception after failure was damaging, and I need to practice separating my value as a person from my performance in a single interview.
Not every opportunity is created equal, but not getting an offer isn't necessarily a reflection of my value.

> I'll do better next time!
