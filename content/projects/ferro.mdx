## 📖 Overview
Ferro is a Rust-based CLI tool thats comprised of quite a few working pieces. In a nutshell,
Its the cli parser, the LLM Interface, and the Git interface; all working together to speed up
my work and reduce cognitive overhead for remedial tasks like coming up with commit message
descriptions.
> That sounds a big cool right? yeah i think so

## ❓ What Problem Did This Solve?
My biggest issue when coding is coming up with words. I suck with words, and thus this thing
you're reading was not easy for me to write! This is also true when creating commit messages,
or even pull request titles and descriptions.

At work, we tend to have some format we like to follow for writing commits and Pr's, but you
still have to come up with a descriptive explanation of what was done. So, often times im reading
through the _diff_ and trying to piece together in a nice short form explanation, which drives me
wild - if i might add.

I came up with the idea to offload all of this work to my local AI, weather that be on my home
network or on my current machine. This is something i absolutely needed, and now i dont have
to think about what i did.

> follow the system prompt that i provide, to keep the commit messages short and following
> the expected format
