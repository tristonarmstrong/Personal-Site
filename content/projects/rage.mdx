Rage is a self-hosted Git repository manager that looks a bit like Gogs or CGit. It lets you create repositories, manage users,
track issues, and collaborate with teams—basically, it's CGit but not CGit.

## ❓ What Problem Did This Solve?
I dont really like the idea of pushing all of my code to github, and github only. I dont
really like the idea of github technically owning my code and practically giving me permission
to edit and pull it. I wanted to self host my own, but all of the alternatives are either
overly complicating to setup or just have far too many features that i just dont really care about.

Im building my own, in rust ofcourse, thats similar to cgit, but rust. The problem that itll solve
for me is that i get to host my own code, but it also wont force me to isolate myself
from the rest of tech (github), by allowing me to mirror push to other git providers out there.

My git host, will be my source of truth, and github will essentially be the backup.
