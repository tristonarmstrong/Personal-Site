## 📖 Overview
zlorbrs is a Rust-based system with three components: `zlorbrs-service` (the monitoring daemon), `zlorbrs-ctl` (a CLI for easy management), and `zlorbrs-lib` (shared functionality). 
It watches Git repositories for updates, performs safe fast-forward merges, and runs build commands when changes are detected or build artifacts are missing.

## 🔑 Key Features
🔍 **Automatic Change Detection**: Tracks repository updates using the `git2` crate.<br/>
🔒 **Safe Git Operations**: Ensures only fast-forward merges are applied.<br/>
🏗️ **Build Triggering**: Executes Bun builds when changes occur or `dist/` is missing.<br/>
⚙️ **Systemd Integration**: Runs reliably with automatic restarts.<br/>
🖥️ **CLI Management**: Easily add, remove, or list repositories without service restarts.<br/>

## ❓ What Problem Did This Solve?
Normally when I push updates to sites I have deployed to the interwebs, i have to sign into my
[VPS](https://www.racknerd.com/) and manually run the build scripts, _which can get annoying_!

I decided I needed some sort of Continous Deployment process set up because I just couldnt take
it anymore! I first thought, i could just use a script and setup some cronjob. I quickly decided
against that as i dont wanna deal with bash but I knew I needed different flows for different repos
and I really couldnt be bothered to try and parse files and such.

I __LOVE__ [Rust](), and said "mhm, yeah we're going rust". Is there any other reason other than me
just liking the language? Nah not really. I mean, i like the ease of development and the feel
of the language. But anyway, yeah, so I built the __ctl__ and the __daemon__ as an easy,
lightweight solution to my initial problem. Now i just push to my repo and the project
auto builds and deploys, thanks to [Git]() and [Nginx]()!
