## üìñ Overview
This homeschool planner allows a user to, without needing an account, the ability to add
their children to the app. Once added, the parent can click on a day and add subjects and
details underneath that subject. Which will display the child/ren on the calendar.

The site also contains resources and affiliate links to useful items that users can
browse if they feel the need.

## ‚ùì What Problem Did This Solve?
I homeschool my children, and needed a free and simple way to manage my childrens corriculum,
that i build myself. I built this site to achieve that, and provide other people who dont have
the funds to subscribe to other platforms, a way to do so without using some other calendar thats
not specifically meant for homeschooling.
