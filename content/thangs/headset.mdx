## What I like about this item
- lightweight
- great sound
- fits well
- long battery (about 2 days continuous)

## How I use it
I use this mostly connected to my workstation. This is a great headset that feels like
it lasts forever. And even when it does die, i put it on charge, go make a coffee, and
its got a few hours of battery life once i get back.
